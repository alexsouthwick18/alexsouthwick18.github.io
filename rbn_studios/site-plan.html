      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Wouldn’t it be convenient to go to the website of your favorite video game company and view all of their games on one page along with reviews, updates, surveys, help forums, and the latest announcements? My brother and I are video game creators. I am creating a website to act as a central hub for all of our projects. Users will be able to purchase our games, view photos, reviews, and update logs, get the latest updates and announcements, and complete surveys to help us know how to make their gaming experience better.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This website is created for fans of our games and potential new players. They will be able to come to this website to look at game reviews, purchase our games, read update logs, and socialize with other community members. While we want our games to be enjoyed by a large audience, some of the content in our games may be unsuitable for children, such as combat and violence. Our intended audience is for teenage players over the age of 13. This particular audience is appropriate for the different styles of games we are wanting to produce and develop.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      On this page, users will be able to read more information about RBN Studios and what we do. RBN Studios was founded in 2020 by two brothers who took up an interest in the video game development industry. After a lot of trial and error, my brother and I released our first game under the title of “Maniac” in October of 2020. The game was released to a particularly large audience and has since reached over 671,900 visits. My brother and I plan to continue creating games for people to play and enjoy. While we don’t have many games released to the public quite yet, we have five different games currently in development. From large open world style games to smaller single player RPG games, RBN Studios will have something to offer that everyone can enjoy.
      <br>
      <br>
      This site will act as a central hub for users to come and learn more information about the games, read reviews, purchase our games, and learn more about what RBN studios has to offer. If someone is looking for a plot synopsis or a game’s rating, they will be able to find that information on the game list page. If they would like to read reviews, they can select the game that they are interested in and see what the community thinks of that particular game. If they would like to purchase the games or make a donation to our company, they will have the opportunity to do so in the store page of the website. No matter what information they would like to know about RBN Studios and its products, they will be able to find it on the website.

      <h3>Games</h3>
      <p>
        Consumers will be able to find a list of all the games RBN Studios has created on the website’s game list page. A list of all playable and purchasable games will be provided. Users may select a particular game that they are interested in and read a brief summary, view the game’s official artwork or trailers, read the reviews of other community members, see the game’s rating, and see the price of the game. This is the page on the website where customers will learn most of the information they desire about a specific game. The games that will be included on the game list will be “Dimensions Divided”, “The I in Team”, “Oversight”, “City of Thieves”, and “Escape”. Each game will have its own description and preview images.
        <br>
        <br>
        Users will be able to leave reviews on the games that we create. If they want to leave a review on the website, they can do so by finding the game they wish to critique on the game list and submitting their review and a rating out of five stars. Users will then be able to read these reviews from the community to help them determine which games they would like or be most interested in. Users may also report bugs and errors that they find by selecting a game and choosing to “report a bug”. This function will allow them to submit bug reports directly to us so that we can make the necessary changes to improve their overall gameplay experience.
