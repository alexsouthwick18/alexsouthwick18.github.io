                <h4>RBN Studios was founded in 2020 by two brothers who took up an interest in the video game development industry. After a lot of trial and error, my brother and I released our first game under the title of “Maniac” in October of 2020. The game was released to a particularly large audience and has since reached over 671,900 visits. My brother and I plan to continue creating games for people to play and enjoy. While we don’t have many games released to the public quite yet, we have five different games currently in development. From large open world style games to smaller single player RPG games, RBN Studios will have something to offer that everyone can enjoy. </h4>
